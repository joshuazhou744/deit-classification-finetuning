## DeiT Fine-tuning with LoRA

This is a simple, lightweight, GPU-less, walkthrough of fine-tuning a small vision transformer, [DeiT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/deit), for image classification on a new class.

The project is modular so you can fine-tune to your desired classification task and save the model (and LoRA adapters). It is also saveable so you can use the model for other purposes.
